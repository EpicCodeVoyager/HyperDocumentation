Initiative to give back!

We are humans and we understand millions and billions better than powers of a number.

*This is still in abstract stage, anyone reading it outside my network. Please don't, It won't make any sense as of now. 
Hope to make it robust and powerful soon.
        
* Billion : 10^9   9 digit numbers

* Million : 10^6   6 digit numbers

* 1000 Million = 1 Billion

* Understanding when to use which variable type for a specific situation.

* Writing tests for each variable type.

* Calculating a single mathematical expression till it takes longer than threshold.

* Calculating a mathematical expression till the result can not be contained in the defined variable.

* Usage of non primitive variables.

* Comparision report of primitive and non primitive variables for same use cases.

* Proper code and class structure for this.
 
* This whole thing might be inspired by mobile app antutu.

* Anyways....

* This is very simple and yet powerful thing to implement.

* CPU and Memory Utilization.

* variable types:> int, long, float, double

* Operators:> + * - ^ |

* Addition: time taken to reach Interger.MAX to Interger.MIN using +

* Subration: tim take to reach Integer.MIN to Interger.MAX using -

* same for multiplication.

* Covering range.

* Covering number of iterations.

* Time calculation till most precise values available in the language.

* Introducing parallelism later on when structure is robust.

* Using other libraries to achieve the same and if possible implementing basics of such functionality and comparing runtime.
