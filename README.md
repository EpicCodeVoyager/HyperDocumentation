We are humans and we understand millions and billions better than powers of a number.

This is still in abstract stage, anyone reading it outside my network. Please don't, It's won't make sense as of now. 
Hope to make it robust and powerful soon.
        
	 * Billion : 10^9   9 digit numbers
	 
         * Million : 10^6   6 digit numbers
         
	 * 1000 Million = 1 Billion
         
	 * Understanding when to use which variable type for a specific situation.
         
         * Writing tests for each variable type:
         
	 * 1. Calculating a single mathematical expression till it takes longer than threshold.
         
	 * 2. Calculating a mathematical expression till the result can not be contained in the defined variable.
         
	 * 3. Usage of non primitive variables.
         
	 * 4. Comparision report of primitive and non primitive variables for same use cases.
         
	 * 5. Proper code and class structure for this.
         
	 * 6. Introducing parallelism later on when structure is robust.
         
	 * 7. Using other libraries to achieve the same and if possible implementing basics of such functionality and comparing runtime.
