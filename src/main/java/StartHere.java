         * Writing tests for each variable type:
         * 1. Calculating a single mathematical expression till it takes longer than threshold.
         * 2. Calculating a mathematical expression till the result can not be contained in the defined variable.
         * 3. Usage of non primitive variables.
         * 4. Comparision report of primitive and non primitive variables for same use cases.
         * 5. Proper code and class structure for this.
         * 6. Introducing parallelism later on when structure is robust.
         * 7. Using other libraries to achieve the same and if possible implementing basics of such functionality and comparing runtime.
